Project Title: Microservices-Based CRUD Application
Project Overview:
This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Microservices Architecture. It enables seamless management of resources across multiple independent services, ensuring scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.
Architecture Overview:
- Microservices: Each core functionality is encapsulated into its own service (e.g., User Service, Product Service, etc.).
- Spring Boot: Used to develop lightweight, stand-alone microservices.
- API Gateway: Acts as a single entry point for routing requests efficiently.
- Service Discovery (Eureka/Consul): Enables automatic discovery of microservices.
- Inter-Service Communication: Uses REST APIs or Feign Clients.
- Database Handling: Each microservice manages its own database for data isolation.

Key Features:
✅ Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operations
✅ Microservices Architecture for Scalability
✅ Secure API Gateway for Routing
✅ Inter-Service Communication via REST APIs
✅ Database Management (MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
✅ Logging & Monitoring for Performance Insights

How It Works:
1️⃣ User sends a request to the API Gateway.
2️⃣ Gateway routes the request to the appropriate microservice.
3️⃣ Microservices communicate with their databases and return a response.
4️⃣ The system ensures secure and optimized performance with Spring Cloud components.

Why Microservices?
- Scalability – Easily scale services independently.
- Flexibility – Update one service without affecting others.
- Resilience – Fault isolation prevents system-wide failures.
- Improved Maintainability – Clear separation of concerns.


This CRUD application with Microservices showcases a modern approach to building scalable, flexible, and efficient applications!
